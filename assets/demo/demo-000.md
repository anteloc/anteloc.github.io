# Fusion Reader

This is a demo PDF file that can be opened with Fusion Reader to test its features.

Fusion Reader is a Mixed Reality PDF reader that requires an AR/VR headset, e.g. Meta Quest. 

Open a PDF file with it and, when entering XR, you will see that file attached to one of your Meta Quest controllers.
